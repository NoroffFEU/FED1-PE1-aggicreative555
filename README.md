# Vinterest | Blog website

## Description:

Welcome to Vinterest, a website where you can read about all things vintage! This website is a **multi-page web** application built with **JS**, **HTML** & **CSS** only. It features various routes for authentication, blog posts, and a create / edit post functionality. I am using the Noroff **API**. The project is built using modern JavaScript practices and deployed to Netlify.
